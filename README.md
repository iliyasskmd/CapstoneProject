Project : Automation Test Engineer Capstone : Testing an Airline Booking Website

Mohammad Iliyas Shaik

Course-end Project 3

DESCRIPTION

This project requires end-to-end development of a comprehensive QA and test environment for an airline booking website. This QA and test environment should be inclusive of the following testing layers:

Browser-based end user testing using Selenium WebDriver Unit testing for backend elements of the website using TestNG API testing with Postman on AWS cloud Automating the whole testing process by creating Jenkins job The end-deliverables will be executable scripts and modules, which can be run on demand for testing the airline booking web app.

Background of the problem statement: Cloud Airlines is a ticket-booking portal that lets people book flights on their website. The website has the following features:

A search form in the homepage is used to enter the travel details like the date of travel, source, destination, and the number of passengers. Based on the travel details entered, it opens a page with the available flight details and their ticket prices. Once a person selects a flight to book, they will be taken to a register page where they must fill in their personal details. On the next page, the flight details are displayed, and the payment is done via a dummy payment gateway. On completion, a confirmation page with the details of the booking will be displayed. The above website is already functional. The objective is to add a testing layer, which will ensure that every component of the website is passed through the QA.

Implementation requirements:

Write an automation script using page object design to store the web elements of the home page Create Selenium scripts to test all the pages in the website Perform unit testing for all backend classes and methods using TestNG Add additional code to the original project to add the REST API module. 
This module will have two API endpoints: 
● Retrieve the list of flights on a given date 
● Retrieve the list of booked seats on a given flight# CapstoneProject
